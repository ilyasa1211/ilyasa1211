# Hi, there! 

## I'm Backend Engineer and Game Developer
-----------------------------------

I've lot of experiences as Backend Engineer, but I'd like to call myself as a Solo Game Developer

*   ðŸ§ Â  I'm learning. ML? Game Physics? Backend Related? That's right and also don't forget about Drawing. Those skills are needed for creating games!
